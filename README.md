# break-the-piggy

Idle game

Overall, I achieved the main parts of the assignment: clicking the pig increments the counter, LocalStorage works correctly, and the API fetch for upgrades was easy to write, although I couldn’t confirm whether the upgrades work because the upgrade button doesn’t respond as intended. I kept my code organised with reusable functions, but I struggled to assemble all the functions together so the upgrades and CPS logic would work properly. LocalStorage appears to save and load correctly, but I also couldn’t confirm whether CPS increments because it is linked to the upgrade logic. I feel confident manipulating the DOM, but some updates couldn’t be fully tested for the same reason. Even though not every feature is fully functional, I learned a lot about structuring JavaScript projects, using APIs, managing state, and connecting different parts of an application.
